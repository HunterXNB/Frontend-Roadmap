<h3 id="tailwindcss"><b>Tailwind CSS</b></h3>

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

#### ðŸ¤” ***Why Tailwind CSS over Bootstrap?***
Some of the benefits of Tailwind over Bootstrap include:
- **Highly customizable**: Tailwind provides a vast collection of small, composable utility classes that you can combine to create unique and custom styles, making it more flexible and adaptable than Bootstrap.
- **Smaller file sizes**: Unlike Bootstrap, which includes a lot of pre-defined CSS code, Tailwind only includes the styles that you use, which can lead to smaller file sizes and faster load times.
- **Mobile-first approach**: Tailwind is built with a mobile-first approach, which means that the default styles are optimized for small screens, making it easier to create responsive designs.
- **No pre-existing design language**: Tailwind doesn't come with pre-built components or a specific design language, which can allow for more creative freedom and better fit with the branding or design language of the project.
